## Introduction

This repository contains example files, tools and configurations for working with [CAMARA](https://camaraproject.org/) APIs. It is maintained by [5G-MAG](https://www.5g-mag.com/) as part of its work on network API standardisation and adoption.

## Contents

### Connectivity Quality Management

Examples and tools for APIs within the scope of [CAMARA Connectivity Quality Management](https://github.com/camaraproject/ConnectivityQualityManagement).

All contents are in the [`ConnectivityQualityManagement`](./ConnectivityQualityManagement) subfolder.

#### Dedicated Networks Portal

A browser-based portal for managing CAMARA Dedicated Networks. It provides a Node.js/Express backend that proxies authenticated CAMARA API calls, and a single-page frontend for:

- Browsing available service areas on an interactive map
- Viewing network profiles and QoS options
- Creating, monitoring and deleting dedicated networks
- Managing device access to a network
- Real-time status updates with adaptive polling (5s while transitioning, 30s when stable)
- Alerts on network activation and expiry

See the [portal README](./ConnectivityQualityManagement/DedicatedNetworks-management-portal/README.md) for setup instructions.

#### Insomnia Collections

Ready-to-import API collections for [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/):

| File | APIs covered |
|------|-------------|
| [`Insomnia_Using_DedicatedNetworks.yaml`](./ConnectivityQualityManagement/Insomnia_Using_DedicatedNetworks.yaml) | Dedicated Networks, Profiles, Accesses |
| [`Insomnia_Using_QoSBooking.yaml`](./ConnectivityQualityManagement/Insomnia_Using_QoSBooking.yaml) | QoS Booking |
| [`Insomnia_Using_QualityonDemand.yaml`](./ConnectivityQualityManagement/Insomnia_Using_QualityonDemand.yaml) | Quality on Demand |
